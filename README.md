# DeclarativeX: Your Declarative HTTP Client üöÄ

## Why Choose DeclarativeX? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Sick of writing boilerplate for every HTTP request? Headers, JSON parsing, and all that jazz? 

Say hello to `DeclarativeX`! 

We handle the nitty-gritty so you can focus on what really counts‚Äîyour core logic.

## üåü Key Features

- **Declarative Goodness**: Decorators make your life easy. Just add and go!
- **Function Over Form**: No need for classes. Check the docs for function-based setups.
- **Data Validation**: Using Pydantic? We've got your robust validation needs covered.
- **Async Ready**: Need it fast? We're async-compatible.
- **Rate Limiting**: Stay on the good side of APIs with built-in rate limiting.
- **Authentication**: Add authentication with a single line of code.
- **Automatic Retries**: We retry failed requests automatically(or reject, if you prefer).
