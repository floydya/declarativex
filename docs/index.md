# Welcome to DeclarativeX ðŸš€

## Introduction

Hey there! Welcome to the official documentation of DeclarativeX. If you're tired of writing boilerplate code for HTTP
clients and want a more declarative approach, you're in the right place. DeclarativeX is designed to make your life
easier, letting you focus on what really mattersâ€”your application logic.

## Installation

Getting started with DeclarativeX is a breeze. Just run the following command:

```bash
pip install declarativex
```

And boom! You're good to go.

## Quick Start Guide

Ready to dive in? Here's a quick example to get you started:

=== "Sync"
    ```{.python title="my_client.py"}
    from declarativex import BaseClient, http
    
    
    @http("GET", "/users/{user_id}", "https://example.com")
    def get_user(user_id: int) -> dict:
        ...
    
    
    response = get_user(user_id=1)
    print(response)
    ```

=== "Async"
    ```{.python title="my_client.py"}
    import asyncio
    
    from declarativex import BaseClient, http
    
    
    @http("GET", "/users/{user_id}", "https://example.com")
    async def get_user(user_id: int) -> dict:
        ...
    
    
    response = asyncio.run(get_user(user_id=1))
    print(response)
    ```

!!! success "You should see the following output:"
    ```
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe"
    }
    ```

!!! tip "Async"
    DeclarativeX supports both synchronous and asynchronous HTTP requests. Just define your function as `async` and
    you're good to go.


See? No fuss, just clean and straightforward code.

## Why DeclarativeX?

- **Less Boilerplate**: No more repetitive code for HTTP methods.
- **Type-Safe**: Built with type annotations for better code quality.
- **Flexible**: Easily extendable to fit your specific needs.
