# Welcome to DeclarativeX ðŸš€

## Introduction

Hey there! Welcome to the official documentation of DeclarativeX. If you're tired of writing boilerplate code for HTTP
clients and want a more declarative approach, you're in the right place. DeclarativeX is designed to make your life
easier, letting you focus on what really mattersâ€”your application logic.

## Installation

Getting started with DeclarativeX is a breeze. Just run the following command:

```bash
pip install declarativex
```

And boom! You're good to go.

## Quick Start Guide

Ready to dive in? Here's a quick example to get you started:

```{.python title="my_client.py"}
from declarativex import BaseClient, http


@http("GET", "/users/{user_id}", "https://example.com")
def get_user(user_id: int) -> dict:
    ...


response = get_user(user_id=1)
print(response)
```

!!! success "You should see the following output:"
    ```
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe"
    }
    ```

See? No fuss, just clean and straightforward code.
