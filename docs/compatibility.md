# Compatibility ü§ù

## Introduction

Hey folks! So, you're wondering how DeclarativeX plays along with other libraries and Python versions, huh? Well, you're
in the right place. Let's break it down.

## Python Versions

DeclarativeX is compatible with Python 3.9 and above. So, if you're still on Python 2 or Python 3.6 (why though?),
it's time to make the jump.

!!! note "Python Version Support"
    DeclarativeX is tested against Python `3.9`, `3.10` and `3.11`. 
    Future versions will be supported as they're released.

## Pydantic Compatibility

We love Pydantic, and we know you do too. That's why DeclarativeX is designed to work seamlessly with both Pydantic v1
and v2.

!!! tip "Pydantic Versions"
    Whether you're on Pydantic v1 or planning to upgrade to v2, DeclarativeX has got your back.

## Async Support

Asynchronous programming is the future, and DeclarativeX is ready for it. 
You can use it with any async framework like FastAPI or Starlette.

!!! info "Async Support"
    DeclarativeX is fully compatible with asynchronous frameworks. 
    Just make sure to use the async methods where applicable.
